# Chess in C++
In this project I implemented a simple Chess game using the CLI in C++. The pieces are represented by their respective letters, with lower case pieces representing the white player, and the upper case letters representing the black player. The game was not designed by me, but I completed the code for each of the functions, I followed a template which designed the game by organising the classes and the game flow.
